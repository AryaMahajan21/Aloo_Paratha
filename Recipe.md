Preparation
1. Boil potatoes just until fork tender without making them mushy. To pressure cook in
traditional cooker, cook for 3 to 4 whistles depending on the size of potatoes. In instant
pot I pressure cooked for 5 mins since I used medium sized potatoes.
2. While the potatoes boil, make the dough. Add flour,oil and salt to a bowl. Pour half cup
water and begin to mix to form a dough. Pour more water as needed and make a soft
yet non-sticky dough.
3. Knead it well until soft & pliable. If you press down the dough with your finger, it should
dent easily meaning it is soft enough. Cover and rest until the filling is ready.
4. When the potatoes are done, cool them slightly and peel while still warm. Ensure your
boiled potatoes are not mushy or soggy.
5. Grate or mash them well until no bits of potatoes remain. Using your fingers break any
chunks of potatoes left in the mash otherwise they will tear the parathas. Also do not
over mash it as the potatoes will turn pasty and sticky.
6. Add ginger, green chilies, coriander leaves, salt, red chilli powder, garam masala,
coriander powder, kasuri methi and chaat masala. Crush the kasuri methi before
adding.
7. Optional: Also add the optional ingredients - ajwain and fennel powder.
8. Mix all of the ingredients gently and taste test it. Add more salt or spices as per your
taste.
9. Divide the aloo stuffing to 8 parts. Also divide the dough to 8 parts. Keep the dough
covered.

How to make aloo paratha

1. Roll a dough ball in your palms to smooth. Lightly sprinkle some flour on the rolling
area. Flatten the dough ball and dip it in some flour.
2. Method 1- Dust off the excess & roll it to a 4 inch disc or roti. Place a portion of aloo
stuffing in the center. Gently bring the sides of the roti up shaping like a cup. Repeat the
steps of pushing the stuffing inside with your finger and bringing the dough up until the
edges come over the stuffing. (Refer video).
3. If the stuffing is sticky, dip your fingers in flour. Bring the edges together over the
stuffing and join them to seal carefully. (Refer step-by-step photo or video).
4. Method 2 - Roll a 5 inch roti and place the stuffing in the center, hold the edges and
make small pleats. Bring all of them on top and join them together to seal the stuffing.
5. Dip the stuffed ball in flour and flatten it gently to spread the stuffing evenly. This
ensures the stuffing does not come out at all. Dust off the excess.
6. Sprinkle some flour on the rolling area .
7. Place the paratha disc on the rolling area with the sealed side down. Begin to roll
evenly all over without putting pressure.
8. Do not roll the aloo paratha continuously. Instead rotate in clock-wise direction a little
after every 4 to 6 rolls to ensure it does not tear or get stuck. Sprinkle flour as needed
and avoid using excess. If you see the stuffing coming out, gently apply some flour to
seal it.
9. Roll the aloo paratha as thin or thick you like without tearing them. I roll mine to 8 to 9
inches.
10. Transfer the rolled ones to a dry area. Once you are done with 3 you can begin to fry
them.
11. Method 3 - With this method, you will be able to make only 6 large parathas. So divide
the dough to 12 and stuffing to 6 parts. Roll 2 rotis of 6 inches each. Spread the aloo
mixture on one of the roti. Wet the edges with little water. Place the other roti on top of
it. Press down gently on the sides to seal both the rotis. Then sprinkle flour and roll it
evenly as thin as you want.

Frying


1. Heat a pan or griddle to cook the aloo parathas. The griddle should be hot enough
otherwise the parathas will turn hard,
2. When the pan is hot, gently transfer a rolled aloo paratha to it.
3. With in 2 to 3 mins, you will see bubbles over it. Then flip it to the other side and cook.
4. You will see the aloo paratha puffs and cooks well. Drizzle ghee or oil all over and flip it
to the other side and cook.
5. Smear some ghee on this side as well and press down the edges to cook thoroughly.
6. Soon you will see golden to light brown spots on the aloo parathas. Remove to a plate
and stack them. This keeps them soft.
7. Top aloo paratha with some butter and serve with pickle or yogurt.
